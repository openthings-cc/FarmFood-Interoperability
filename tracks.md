Ideally, the points explained below involve continuous delivery thus the work can be demoed periodically.

Track-1 - Infrastructure and Applications.
---

* To build open-source [applications](./applications.md) to bootstrap the practical use of the outputs. 
* To set up and manage databases and services. 

Track-2 - Integration and Vocabulary mapping.
---

* To build up adapters of the existent open source applications.
* Support a community to build up the multilingual vocabulary mappings of the core dataset.
   
Track-3 - Communications, Data exploitation and sustainability.
---

The mechanisms to make the results attractive to target communities should be investigated.

* To Provide new value propositions, unlocking the possibility of constructing services with multi-modal and geo-spatial capabilities.
* To let agents know how to discover public offers on their local area, such as products, delivery, news, recipes etc.
