Fair prices 
---

To pay a fair price to the farmer, creating economic value on the countryside. Since data is public, deliveries can be planned to spend shared resources between farmers. End consumers such as private households, neighborhoods, companies, public organizations will pay for their grocerâ€™s a price that is fair and not too expensive, comparable to a good quality product in any other grocery shop. Indeed, the short supply chain will allow prices to be fair and affordable.  Farmers are able to transition into new short supply chains, having new options to trade their products out of the traditional mass markets.
