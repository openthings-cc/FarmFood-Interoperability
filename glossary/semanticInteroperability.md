## Semantic interoperability
Semantic interoperability refers to the ability to transmit data with unambiguous and shared meaning. In order to share information between distinct systems the first step is to create explicit artifacts that enable the community to construct a data transformations or data mediation mappings between a data sources and a destinations. These explicit artifacts should be agreed by the community, otherwise the meaning is not shared.
