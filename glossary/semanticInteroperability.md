## Semantic interoperability
Semantic interoperability refers to the ability to transmit data with unambiguous and shared meaning. If one wants to share information between distinct systems, the first step is to create explicit artifacts that enable the community to construct data transformations or data mediation mappings between data sources and destinations. The communities should agree with these artifacts, otherwise, the meaning is not shared.
