Payment pool
---

Since each agent can publish their offering of products, delivery services, storage, cooking, picking etc. An application can consolidate an economic transaction composed by multiple distributed offerings. This means it is possible to track precisely what are the costs of performing that transaction or use algorithms to search for the best combination that provides best value. In this sense, all the distributed data repositories can constitute together a general marketplace

To minimize transaction costs, groups of people could build benefit from payment pools in order to perform numerous transactions together. A payment pool could be released for payment when certain threshold is reached or is explicitly triggered by the receiver agent. The receiver agent in this way decides the trade-off between having frequent payments at high transaction costs or less costs but lower payment frequency. 

The payment pool mechanism is an improvement towards commons based economies. For example a community of farmers can form a payment pool where the payments will be distributed according an internal rule.
