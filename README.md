Linked Data for local farming interoperability
---

On farms and in food businesses around the world, people are inventing creative solutions every day. As we rebuild the small farm economy and reintegrate agriculture as a central part of our lives, we need tools we that are appropriately scaled to suit our needs as regional producers feeding local communities. There are several organizations worldwide which follow this vision, but unfortunately they are not well integrated together. Any attempt to scale these efforts and make them cooperate in a sustainable way will be in need of efficient coordination and logistics, which in turn need data described in unified ways. This dataset aims towards improving the organic food delivery processes and consumer satisfaction through linked data infrastructures, having unified ways of describing all actors (farmers, suppliers, retailers etc.) food, ingredients and open means to track their origin.

We want to set up some basic tools to enable [Semantic Interoperability](./glossary/semanticInteroperability.md). We don't want to create yet another shopping cart of organic products but to build up mechanisms to integrate the different kinds of tools that are already on the market.

Each tool address the different solutions and business models depending on their local context. We believe in the power of networks, we envisage an opportunity where producers to be linked, where they have the freedom of codifying their products and offerings in their own terms, opening up a heterogeneous marketplaces. Producers need to be in control of the data they produce, choosing which part of this data they share with others. This is basic and essential towards decentralization.

The emergence of several different non-adhoc food supply chains enforces us to map the evolving needs of data to support the basic requirements. These kind of systems are distributed and heterogeneous, in this sense we need to experiment and propose different data collection systems to find out how these distributed systems can work with the existing standards. We need to tackle several aspects regarding data production, such as privacy, data governance, processing and data sharing practices.
